Notes on webgpu backend.

4/5/2025:
Synced libgdx repo on 4/5/2005 (latest update from 27/04/2025). Version 1.13.2.
Uses Gradle 8.12.

Error message: This project uses AGP 8.7.3, latest supported AGP is 7.4.0.
It means the IDE doesn't support the required version of the Android Gradle Plugin.
This is fixed by updating Intellij IDEA to update 2025.1 (built April 15, 2025).

Started creating gdx-backend-webgpu by copying gdx-backend-lwjgl3 and renaming
everything Lwjgl3 to WebGPU.

For now, copied all the backend files even when it is not graphics API related,
e.g. audio. Accept or deal with the code duplication later.

How to deal with multiple platforms? We are now tied to the LWJGL3 one.

5/5/2025:
Created tests/gdx-tests-webgpu based on gdx-tests-lwjgl3.

Trying to call java-to-webgpu from a test programme HelloTriangle.

Apparently java-to-webgpu required JDK 17 and tests require Java runtime 8.
Where does JVM 8 come from? Not clear from build.gradle.
It just says:
    sourceCompatibility = versions.java
    targetCompatibility = versions.java


   > Could not resolve com.github.MonstrousSoftware:java-to-webgpu:1.01.
     Required by:
         project :tests:gdx-tests-webgpu
      > Dependency resolution is looking for a library compatible with JVM runtime version 8, but 'com.github.MonstrousSoftware:java-to-webgpu:1.01' is only compatible with JVM runtime version 17 or newer.


 Tried placing the generated jnr files in the libgdx backend (backends.webgpu.webgpu).  Needed to adapt the jnr generator to create the correct
 package name and import statements.
