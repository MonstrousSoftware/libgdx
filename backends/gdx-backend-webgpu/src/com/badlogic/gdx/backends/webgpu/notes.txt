Notes on webgpu backend.

4/5/2025:
Synced libgdx repo on 4/5/2005 (latest update from 27/04/2025). Version 1.13.2.
Uses Gradle 8.12.

Error message: This project uses AGP 8.7.3, latest supported AGP is 7.4.0.
It means the IDE doesn't support the required version of the Android Gradle Plugin.
This is fixed by updating Intellij IDEA to update 2025.1 (built April 15, 2025).

Started creating gdx-backend-webgpu by copying gdx-backend-lwjgl3 and renaming
everything Lwjgl3 to WebGPU.

For now, copied all the backend files even when it is not graphics API related,
e.g. audio. Accept or deal with the code duplication later.

How to deal with multiple platforms? We are now tied to the LWJGL3 one.

5/5/2025:
Created tests/gdx-tests-webgpu based on gdx-tests-lwjgl3.
